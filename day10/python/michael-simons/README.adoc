I like python.

Here's the idea to solve this puzzle. 
First have some basic geometry:

[source,python,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.py[tags=basicGeometry]
----

Than

[source,python,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.py[tags=solutionPart1]
----
<.> Create the cross product of each asteroid with all others.
<.> Compute the direction and the norm of the directional vector for each pair.
<.> Store all targets per direction into a list
<.> Sort that list by direction
<.> Select the one that has most outgoing directions

That's the base.
From there on:

[source,python,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.py[tags=solutionPart2]
----
<.> Go through all targeteting directions, counterclockwise
<.> Hit the first
<.> And move on.


NOTE: Run with `python3 Solution.py`. Tested with `Python 3.7.0`.
      +
      Correct solutions are `263` and `1110`, 
      expected solutions for `test-input2.txt` are `210` and `802`
      and `30` and `1203` for `test-input3.txt`
