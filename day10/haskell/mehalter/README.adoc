== Monitoring Station

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

This solution uses a brute force method for part 1 to check which asteroid can
see the most number of other asteroids.

For part 2, I used arctangent to calculate the angle an asteroid is from
straight up from the asteroid firing the laser. Then sorts by the angles to get
the vaporization order.
