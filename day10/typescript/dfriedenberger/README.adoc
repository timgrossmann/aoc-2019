== Monitoring Station

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution2.js
....

Implement AsteroidMap with document first, so I was thinking implementing the following functions:

* add row (calculate width and high)
* is an asteroid at x,y
* cnt asteroids in diagonal
* cnt reachable asteroids from x,y
* find best position

for vaporization i would sort arrays by angle and distance.
....
include::src/AsteroidMap.ts[]
....


=== First Start
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=find]
....


=== Second Star
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution2.ts[tag=vaporize]
....
