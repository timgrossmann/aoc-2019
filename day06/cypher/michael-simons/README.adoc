I was so hoping for something to be solved with the help of my favorite database and query language.
Enter https://neo4j.com[Neo4j] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language)[Cypher].

As with my SQL solution for day1, I'm gonna run all of this in a dockerized version of the database.

----
docker run -d -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e 'NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/secret' --name neo4j1 neo4j:3.5.13 # <1>
docker cp input.txt neo4j1:/var/lib/neo4j/import # <2>
docker exec -it neo4j1 cypher-shell -u neo4j -p secret # <3>
----
<1> Startup a Neo4j container, publish the HTTP and Bolt ports and define a passwort (`secret`)
<2> Copy the input file into Neo4j's import directory
<3> Login into the container and open the cypher shell for executing commandos.

I'm gonna use the shell, but you can of course also use the http://localhost:7474/browser/[Neo4j browser].
It has a friendly interface to get you started with your first graph and some nice visualisations.
Here's the one from the puzzle's description:

I'm gonna use `LOAD CSV` as described (among other things) in one of my https://speakerdeck.com/michaelsimons/going-from-relational-databases-to-databases-with-relations-with-neo4j-and-spring-data-b5522486-f2bb-4609-9a35-be54feae6702[Neo4j related talks].
`LOAD CSV` processes CSV files line by line and takes in an optional field separator, which will be `)` in our case:

[source,cypher]
----
include::prepare.cypher[]
----
<1> Create `Object` nodes. We use a merge statement, that checks whether a given pattern exists or not to avoid duplicates
<2> Create the `ORBITS` relationship between the objects.
    We could have done all of this in one step, but than nodes would have been duplicated, as `MERGE` always checks for
    the existence of the whole pattern.

Having the data, both star one and star two are rather short Cypher statements:

[source,cypher]
----
include::star1.cypher[]
----

This reads: "Match the object named 'COM' (Center of Mass), than match the path from all other objects to this object and return the sum of the length of those paths.".
This works because the input is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)[tree] respectivly a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[directed acyclic graph], to be precise.

Star two uses the built-in `shortestPath` operation

[source,cypher]
----
include::star2.cypher[]
----
<1> Find the starting objects (one step away from `YOU` and `SAN`)
<2> Pass them on to the next section of the query
<3> Match the shortest path and return its length.

And with the SQL example from day 1: Don't just dump unstructured data into your databases.
Use them the way they where meant to be used.

NOTE: Tested with `neo4j:3.5.13`
      Correct solutions are: `135690` and `298`.
