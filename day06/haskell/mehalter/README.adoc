== Universal Orbit Map

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

This solution takes a dynamic programming approach to finding the total orbits,
and maps to find the path between you and Santa
