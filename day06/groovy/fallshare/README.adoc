== Day05

This is the solution for the second day of AoC:

Yeah finally a graph.
Here is my plan for today:
    In phase 1 I focus on creating a object structure that reprents my graph.
    Every object is unique and itentified by its name.
    I introduce a UniverseCreator class that keeps track of all space objects.
    If a required space object is not existing yet it will be created.
    Afterwards the objects will be linked.
    
    In phase 2 I will try to extract the required information from the graph.

=== Star 1
Got that one done. Using some recursion got the tricky part done.

=== Star 2
Got that one done too. Here the trick was to find the common orbit 
and calculate the distance from santa and me to the orbit and sum up the distances.
