=== About me

I am a father, husband and athlete (the later is probably just wishful thinking).
Apart from that, I'm also a Java Champion, Oracle Cloud Groundbreaker ambassador, published author, JUG leader and currently working on Spring Data and Neo4j-OGM at Neo4j.
In this role, my main focus is providing first class support of Neo4j in the Spring Environment, but also made contributions to Testcontainers, Spring Boot, Quarkus and a lot of other projects.
