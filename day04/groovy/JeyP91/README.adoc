=== Split number into single positions

To split a number into its single positions a combination of modulo and divions is used.

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=splitUpNumber]
....

=== Check rules

For each rule a method is implemented to evaluate the rule

Example: check if the digits do not decrease

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=checkNeverDecrease]
....

=== While iterating over all numbers in range of 235741-706948, add them to the lists if the rules apply.
