== Secure Container

For this task I chose to just iterate over the range and check each candidate.
There might be a better sollution, but the possible values are still small enough to just check every value.

.First Star
[source]
....
include::day04.groovy[tags=firstStar]
....

.Second Star
[source]
....
include::day04.groovy[tags=secondStar]
....
