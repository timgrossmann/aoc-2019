== Secure Container

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

My solution takes a brute force approach that checks to see if all the
numbers in the specified range have sorted digits and duplicate items. The
second part makes sure that at least one item has exactly 2 appearances.
