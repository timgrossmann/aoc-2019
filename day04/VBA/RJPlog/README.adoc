== Day 4: Secure Container

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4

Today I did it just with calculation of all variants by interlaced for loops and then checking if the number fits the rules, nothing special about that.

For the last part with my puzzle input I had to check manually in the excelsheet.

I struggled to put the 6 numbers together to a number which I could check if inbound or outbound. Even with using long it does not work.

Maybe that's something I will figure out later, in the moment I am glad to be through for day04.
