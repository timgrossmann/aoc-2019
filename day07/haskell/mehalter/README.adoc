== Amplification Circuit

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

This solution extends my Day 05 solution by changing the inputs and outputs to
the compute function to allow for daisy chaining computers together, and for
part 2, have the ability to start a computer back up at a given state.
