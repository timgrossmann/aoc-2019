== Amplification Circuit

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`runhaskell answer.hs`.

This solution extends my Day 05 solution by changing the inputs and outputs to
the compute function to allow for daisy chaining computers together, and for
part 2, have the ability to start a computer back up at a given state.
