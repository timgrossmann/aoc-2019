Iâ€™m not a professional developer and only doing this for fun. The solutions might be messy.

== Day 07
Gave the intcomp its own file. For star 1, I used quinary (digits from 0 to 4) to go through all possible phase settings
in a single for loop.

For star 2, I added return values to the execution of a program: the current state of the program as a list of ints and the pointer
to the instruction where the program halted.
