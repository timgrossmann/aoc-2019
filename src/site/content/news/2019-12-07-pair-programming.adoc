As a developer doing https://adventofcode.com[Advent of Code] puzzles, you probably already know about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming[pair programming] but how often do you pair program?

Chances are that you (like me) nearly never do pair programming.
But why not share the fun of Advent of Code and solve one puzzle with pair programming?

Go and find someone at home or at work, grab a hot cup of coffee and try to solve one of the puzzles during the next #c0ffee break together!
Share your keyboard and screen and try to solve the puzzle together!

Happy second Advent!

Ralf
