Say Intcode computer one more timeâ€¦

Anyway.

Today, we got relative parameter modes and a bigger address space. I build this on my https://github.com/docToolchain/aoc-2019/blob/master/day07/java/michael-simons/Solution.java#L52[Java solution] for day 7.

Bigger address space has been solved with a view on the runnning program:

[source,java,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=memorySpace]
----
<1> Implementing relative memory in one go

The listing also shows the relative memory.
One more new instruction to modify it:

[source,java,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=relativeMemory]
----

I also split my `io` stack into both `stdIn` and `stdOut` and throw an exception
when the computer requries input:

[source,java,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=newIoHandling]
----

Reading and writing to standard io is now internal to the computer.
Input can be piped into it. The computer doesn't return anything now on run.
Output can be accessed via `head()` or `drain()`:

[source,java,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=usingNewIo]
----

I changed this from day 7, so that I can use the amplication circuit with todays computer.
Todays computer should not halt after it produced output, in my day 7 solution, it needed to halt.

IMPORTANT: Biggest challenge today?
Can you spot the bug in my day 7 solution? Well, I couldn't for some time.
There's one tiny, little instruction that just didn't get hit on day 7.
Well, now it does.

For the second star, I needed to drop the recursion, as the stack size went too big.

NOTE: Run with `java --source 13 --enable-preview Solution.java`.
      Tested with `java version "13" 2019-09-17`, correct solutions are: `3601950151` and `64236`.
