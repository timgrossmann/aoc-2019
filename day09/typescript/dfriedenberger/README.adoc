== Sensor Boost

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution2.js
....

Extension of classes was easy, only add relative parameter mode 

....
include::src/Program.ts[tag=getIndex]
....
and handling for opcode 9.
....
include::src/Computer.ts[tag=opcode9]
....

Extending other capabilities was not necessary. Large numbers are supported from number object in Typescript and array is automaticly extended if write a value to new index. Only return 0 if index not exists was added.
....
include::src/Program.ts[tag=getInput1]
....

Furthermore wrote my first static function in TypeScript.
....
include::src/Computer.ts[tag=load]
....

=== First and Second Star

Difference between solution one and two is the used input parameter.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=permutation]
....
