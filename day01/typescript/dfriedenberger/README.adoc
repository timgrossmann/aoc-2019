== The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

This solution is written in Typescript.
I decided for Typescript because want write better Javascript.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution1.js
....

Need some classes
- Modul
- Spacecraft

For each solution implement own calculator service

[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/CalculateFuelService.ts[]
....

[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/CalculateFuelWithFuelService.ts[]
....

include::src/solution1.ts[]
....

=== Second Star

[source, typescript, numbered]
