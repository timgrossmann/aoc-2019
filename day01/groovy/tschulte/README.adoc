== The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

=== First Star

The sollution for the first star was pretty straightforward.
Iterate over all lines in the input file, convert the line's content to an int, calculate the required fuel and sum all values.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day01_1.groovy[]
....

=== Second Star

For the second star, I first misunderstood the problem and tried to take the result from the first star and calculate the required fuel for that.
But that resulted in a wrong value.

The final solution was to refactor the calculateFuel to recursively call itself, when the fuel was greater than 0.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day01_2.groovy[tags=calculateFuelRecursive]
....
