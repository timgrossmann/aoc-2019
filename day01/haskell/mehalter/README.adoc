== The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the `run.sh`
bash script to feed in the inputs defined in the `input` file as arguments to
the Haskell script defined in `answer.hs`.

My solutions define the math equation as a function for both part one and part
two, and maps the function across the array of integers passed in as command
line arguments.
