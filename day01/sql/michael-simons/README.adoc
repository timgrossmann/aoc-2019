== https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1[The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation]: The database strikes back

This one is a solution just for fun. 
Why not solving the thing with SQL?

I did this with PostgreSQL, which supports https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/queries-with.html[recursive common table expressions].

First, change into the directory of this solution, bring up a Docker container running the latest PostgreSQL version, copy the `input.txt` into it and get a bash shell:

[source,console]
----
docker run -d -p 5432:5432  --name postgres1 postgres
docker cp input.txt postgres1:/tmp/
docker exec -it postgres1 bash
----

From there, we create a database and login:

[source,console]
----
createdb -U postgres aoc
psql -U postgres aoc
----

First, create a table and load the data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE modules(mass INTEGER);
COPY modules(mass) FROM '/tmp/input.txt';
----

First star is trivial:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sum(mass/3-2) FROM modules;
----

Second star is fun:

[source,sql]
----
WITH RECURSIVE fuel_for_fuel(fuel) AS ( -- <1>
  SELECT mass/3-2 from modules -- <2>
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM ( -- <3>
    SELECT fuel/3-2 AS fuel FROM fuel_for_fuel
  ) hlp WHERE fuel > 0
)
SELECT sum(fuel) from fuel_for_fuel;
----
<1> Declare a recursive common table expression
<2> Define the initial value
<3> Recursively select from `fuel_for_fuel`. The nested from clause is only needed to avoid having the equation thrice.

Because? It's fun.
