I could reuse my day 9 solution completely, which is kinda good, I guess.
I added a `reset` method to the computer, so that I don't need to reload the program each time.

Nothing special to the solution of the puzzle.
Basic walking around stuff.
As I will stick in https://www.javaland.eu/de/[Javaland] with IntComputer tasks, I might as well do it nicely object oriented with a bunch of classes:

[source,java,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=basicComponents]
----

You get the idea:
A `Direction` is derived from an instruction,
a `View` uses that direction to compute the next view
and a `Panel` uses that to compute the next one.

Given an enum `Color` with appropriate method to load and represent it self, the solution basically is the prose above:

[source,java,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=color]

include::Solution.java[tags=solution]
----
<.> Probably the most intesting thing here: Creating a comparator for the panels.
    This saves me from adding `equals` and `hashCode` to panel, as I use a `TreeMap` for storing them.
    The `TreeMap` identifies two objects as equal when they are comparing to `0`.
    I could `Panel`  let implement `Comparable`, but than the comparision would always be the same.
    For my usecase (painting / printing) them, I want to to be ordered by their `y`-axis in reversed order first, than by `x`.
<.> I don't use `computeIfAbsent` here as I'm gonna put the panel into the map anyway, thus avoiding one operation.

I think that the above solution is a nice way of speaking the domains language without creating ivory towers.

Bonus: I added some handler code that gets each state event and can create this:

NOTE: Run with `java --source 13 --enable-preview Solution.java`.
      Tested with `java version "13" 2019-09-17`, correct solutions are: `1732` and `ABCLFUHJ`.
