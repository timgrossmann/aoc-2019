== Space Image Format

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

This solution takes the input as an array of characters, splits it into the
layers, and does a search through the layers to calculate part 1 and to decode
the image for part 2.
