Solution for Day 08 of the AoC 2019: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8[Day 8: Space Image Format]

== Solution

Some straight-forward array operations - I would say there is nothing really special here.
The Image and Layer classes:

....
include::Image.h
....

And the final solution:

....
include::solution.cpp
....

Only thing I really had problems with, is that I mixed x and y in the beginning and the image really looks strange then...
