== Hello World

Hello World!

Kotlin has extension functions that can be used to extend existing classes.
Like in this case `File.readText():String`.
This function is not available in `java.io.File`.
The Kotlin compiler will generate the proper call to the function make the relevant object available as thise.
Think of like a named Lambda.
