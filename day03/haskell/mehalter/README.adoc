== Crossed Wires

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

My solution takes a brute force approach that generates all the points each
wire touches using the `getAllPoints` function, then gets the intersection of
the two wire points to get all the places the wires cross.

My solution for part 1 then takes the intersection, finds the closest one to the
central point, and calculates the Manhattan distance.

My solution for part 2 takes the intersection, calculates how many steps it
takes to get to each of the crosses, and returns the minimum steps to reach a
cross.
