== Crossed Wires

This solution is written in Typescript.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution1.js
....

First implementing the Wire class. It's handle convertion from path to x,y-Coordinates in constructor 
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Wire.ts[tag=constructor]
....

and find crosses by comparing the coordinates
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Wire.ts[tag=cross]
....

=== First Star
This was solved by implementing ManhattanDistance (here first time uses interfaces in Typescript)
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/ManhattanDistance.ts[tag=distance]
....

and find the minimum of the distances.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/ShortestDistance.ts[]
....

=== Second Star

Second solution solved by replacing the Implementation of Distance from ManhattanDistance to SignalDelayDistance
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=distance]
....

[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution2.ts[tag=distance]
....


SignalDelayDistance uses map of distances created during Wire construction
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/SignalDelayDistance.ts[]
....
