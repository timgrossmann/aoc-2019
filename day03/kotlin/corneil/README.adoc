== Crossed Wires

I chose to model a Grid with Cells.
Each movement will result in activity on a cell and create them as needed.
Steps was later added to the cells for each wire and recorded as the grid was populated.
There are some flaws in the when you have 3 wires a total value cannot be used to indicate an intersection.
The intersections will have to be recorded in a different mechanism.
