Day 3 Solution in Python

== Disclaimer

The code of this solution is not perfect in any way but it seems to do its job.
This is due to the fact that I don't want to entirely miss the AOC this year
again due to family implications but instead participate in an efficient way.

So don't expect fancy interface descriptions and nicely edited readmes unless
I need it myself to handle the complexity of the puzzle :-)

== Day 03 Notes

At first I didn't read the instructions thoroughly and thought the input was
about checkerboard style coordinates with letters for x and numbers for y axis.
I spent 1 hour coding the totally wrong solution until I asked myself where
to find the central port (since both paths seemingly started from different
locations).
Re-reading the instructions I got aware of the fact that only letters R, L, U
and D are used...
