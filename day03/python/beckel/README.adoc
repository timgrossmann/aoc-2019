Day 3 - Solution in Python

numpy for better array handling!

Star 1:
Performance issue: Instead of checking for intersections WHILE putting the cable on the board, I first put both cables on the board (in a big 2-dim array) and checked for intersections later on. Unfortunately, the covered area is bigger than expected (~8000x8000 fields), so checking 64M fields for intersections takes a few minutes. 
Star 2 requires refactoring such that intersections are computed (and returned) on the fly - should be a easy thing with the current architecture.

After refactoring, everything is quite quick now ...
