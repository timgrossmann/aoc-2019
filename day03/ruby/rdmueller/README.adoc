I start to recognize that I use a special coding style when I code in a new language.
Let's call it the smallest common subset style (scs-style).
I hate to look up language features because it is time consuming.
So instead to use the best language constructs, I use the features which are most likely to work, because they are common to all languages.

As an example, I started to use `if-then-else` instead of a switch statement.
That is horrible and doesn't teach me anything.
So I wonder if it makes sense to first code in a language which I know well (Groovy) and then translate it to Ruby?
