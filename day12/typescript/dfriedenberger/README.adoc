== The N-Body Problem

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution2.js
....

=== First Star

Solved solution one by implementing Space and Moon.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Moon.ts[]
....

....
include::src/Space.ts[]
....


Then run 1000 time steps
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=timesteps]
....

=== Second Star

Second solution tried by brute force. As expected would need very long time before repeating. 
So I tried with success calculating cycle for each index (because indexes are independent)
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution2.ts[tag=cycle]
....

Furthermore hat to take the divisors into consideration, so I calculated ggt (copied from internet)
....
include::src/solution2.ts[tag=ggt]
....

The result I calculated with calctool.de
++++
(22958 / 2) * (231614 / 2) * (286332 / 2) * 2
++++
