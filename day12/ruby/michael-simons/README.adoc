I had help today on a business trip to MalmÃ¶ and I liked it very much:

Honestly, I would have come up with a solution for part 2 today without staring at the slowly increments of by brute force loop with my wife seeing that the axis and their velocities are independent.

And yes, https://twitter.com/ericwastl[Eric Wastl] was very right with:

"This set of initial positions takes 4686774924 steps before it repeats a previous state! Clearly, you might need to find a more efficient way to simulate the universe."
-- Advent of Code 2019, Day 12

Today we used Ruby again. Some highlights:

[source,ruby,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=monkeyPatching]
----

Open classes, yeah! Here adding a pairwise `add` to Rubys array class

We added some classes that allow adding and applying gravity and velocity like this:

[source,ruby,numbered,indent=0]
----
# Other methods obmitteted for brevity

include::solution.rb[tags=moon]
----

Than first part is fairly trivial and again, readable as in the puzzle:


[source,ruby,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=starOne]
----
<.> Cloning the input because we need it unmodified later
<.> Create pairs of moons and apply their gravity onto each other
<.> This reduction is nice: Map take's a block taking the mapped value, 
    but we can use `&` to turn the element of the block into a proc and calling
    the symbolic name `energy` (via the `:`) on it, that happens to be our computation for the enegery.

Second star was hard for me to spot... Implementation than was easy:

[source,ruby,numbered,indent=0]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=starTwo]
----
<.>  On three axis independently, check whether it has seen before in this combination (combination of all moon's axis in question)
<.> Break if the moons happened to be back or when all axis have completed a cycle
<.> Reduce the number of cycles to their least common multple

Fun stuff to do and I'm really happy about it.

NOTE: Tested with `ruby 2.6.3p62`
      Correct solutions are: `7013` and `324618307124784`
