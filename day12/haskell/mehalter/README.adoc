== The N-Body Problem

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

My solution for part 1 is pretty straight forward, define a `timeStep` function
that calculates the new velocities and then positions for each of the moons for
a single time step. Then the `timeSteps` function loops for a given number of
time steps, and then a `totalEnergy` function calculates the sum of all the
positions times velocities of each moon.

Part 2 was a little trickier, and came after realizing that the positions and
velocities are periodic, and therefore the first repeated state must be the same
as the initial state. Then because the 3 axes are changing independently of each
other, you can find cycle of each axis, and calculate the least common multiple
of the 3. This allows you to go through much fewer time steps and still find the
total cycle of the system.
