Star 1 was straightforward. For star 2, the "trick" (at least for me) was not to make the simulation more efficient.
Instead, it was to realize that the axes are independent, so it is enough to simulate only until a period in each axis has been found.
The period for the entire system then has to be the least common multiple of the individual axes' periods.
