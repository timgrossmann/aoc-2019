== 1202 Program Alarm

The first method `parseInput` takes the input string, splits it and converts each element to an int.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day02.groovy[tags=parseInput]
....

The second method takes the input, replaces it in place with the changed values and returns the output value.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day02.groovy[tags=computeOutput]
....

Now we need a method to replace the noun and the verb.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day02.groovy[tags=restoreState]
....

Putting it all together to get the first star.
We create a copy of the input list, because we will need the input unchanged for the second star, and `computeOutput` alters the input list.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day02.groovy[tags=starOne]
....

For the second star, we try every combination of noun and verb in the range 0..99 brute force.
Maybe there is a better sollution, but this is fast enough and not worth the effort.

[source,groovy]
....
include::day02.groovy[tags=bruteForce]
