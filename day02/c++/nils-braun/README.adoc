Solution for Day 02 of the AoC 2019: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2[Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm]

== Solution

I solved it with a rather brute-force ansatz - probably one can also solve it better
but it just worked.

Array computation is quite simple in C++, I though about using iterators but in 
principle it makes no difference (std::vector iterators are also just index numbers)
for me in this case.

I forgot about the std::getline function, which is quite handy in this context.
