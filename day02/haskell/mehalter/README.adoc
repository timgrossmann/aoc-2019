== 1202 Program Alarm

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

My solution for part 1 defines a recursive function `comp`, that computes a single step of
the computer and then continues to call itself with the next instruction address
until it encounters an error or the halt opcode, `99`.

My solution for part 2 defines a brute force recursive function `findParamsBrute`, that checks to
see if a set of params results in the expected output. If it doesn't, it calls
itself with the parameters updated accordingly, and runs until the desired
output is found.

I also added a `O(1)` solution specific to the challenege input, that calculates
the correct params for a given final answer based on the rate of change caused
by the first and second parameters. A single unit increase in the first parameter
causes a change of +243000, while a single unit increase in the second parameter
causes a change of +1. Knowing this, and the fact that the initial result given
parameters `[0, 0]` is 493708, we can solve for the correct parameters in a
single calculation.
