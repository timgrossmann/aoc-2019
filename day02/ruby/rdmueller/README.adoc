== 1202 Program Alarm

Today, my quality criteria is just to do it quick.
I only have time to spend while I commute, so apox 15 minutes in each direction.
Let's go!

=== First Star

I need a little interpreter for the code isntructions.
First time, I didn't get the reference right, but then I noticed that I had to use the instruction of the instruction (Ã¬nt[int[x]]) and everything worked out.

.First Star
[source, ruby, numbered]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=star1]
----

=== Second Star

The code for the first star started out as a simple script.
For the second star, I wrapped it as method and iterated brute force over it until it matched the result.

.Second Star
[source, ruby, numbered]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=star2]
