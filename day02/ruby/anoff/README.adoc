Puzzle: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2[1202 Program Alarm]

== Part 1

At first I was reminded of last years puzzle.
But thinking about it for a while it seemed to be the best approach to just manipulate the program in memory.
After figuring out how ruby passes data - by argument - the implementation was rather straight forward.

However I forgot to RTFM again and did not configure my program prior to start and was wondering why test cases passed and the program failed.

== Part 2

The major challenge for part 2 was to figure out how I can clone a list in ruby to make sure that each program execution really starts with a clean memory.

== Solution

[source, ruby]
....
include::solution.rb[]
....

=== Test cases

[source, ruby]
....
include::solution_test.rb[]
....
