No need to install and configure Python on your host, just use VSCode and the remote development extension pack for running the code without polluting your host. It's magic ‚ú®

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
```

Open folder in VSCode and re-open folder inside of the dev container by running the quick action

```
Select Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...
```

Run the code via the integrated VSCode terminal

```bash
python solution.py
```
