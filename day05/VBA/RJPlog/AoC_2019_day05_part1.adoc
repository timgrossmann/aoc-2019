== Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5

First and second part solved. Especially the second part made some difficulties with those nested if's for position mode and immediate mode.
I had to test every single case, which I started unstructured, therefore I did it over and over :-)

Details to be found in VBA :-). If I have time in the evening, I will add some comments in the readme.
