== Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`runhaskell answer.hs`.

This solution extends my Day 02 solution by adding extra checks and functionality
for the new op codes.
