= Advent of Code - Day 05

Task is to add multiple additional opcodes to the Intcode computer of day 02.

== Add opcode-parameters

Each instruction can have additional parameters now. To separate the actual opcode from the parameters modulo and division is used:

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=opcodeParameters]
....

== Instruction Execution

Each instruction execution basically consists out of 3 steps:

=== 1. Calculate needed values

Here the interesting part is the usage of the parameters of the instruction. Depending on 0 or 1 either the value at the location is used, or the value is a pointer to another location from which the value shall be used.

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=lessThen1]
....

=== 2. Execute instruction

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=lessThen2]
....

=== 3. Jump to next instruction

[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=lessThen3]
....
