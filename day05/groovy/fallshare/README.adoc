== Day05

This is the solution for the second day of AoC:
https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5[Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids ]

I use this readme to collect all the thoughts and ideas I'm having for the challenge.
This is a loose connection of all the thoughts I'm having.
I need:
* a program or instruction counter, that is incremented after the instruction is finished
* a functionn that reads the next opcode and the parameters that belong to it
* a way how to resolve the parameter mode

I'm currently lacking the time to write a proper documentation.
What I can say is that I implemented all the thoughts mentioned above.
