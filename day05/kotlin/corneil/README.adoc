== Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

I found a phrase in the description ambiguous.

_Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode._

When in reality the value refered to in the parameter is always the address.
In my reading this means it is always in immediate mode.

I have a class the represents the program counter `ProgramCounter` and a class for the executing state `ProgramState`
The program state loads the code into mutable memory and resets the program counter.
Each instruction modifies memory and returns a new program counter.

I couldn't decide if the program counter belongs in the program state or if it should be passed along.
