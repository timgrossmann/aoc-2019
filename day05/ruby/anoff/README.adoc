Puzzle: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5[Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids]

== Part 1

Luckily I could re-use a lot of day2 code.
The main changes were adding new opcodes and initially splitting the opcode and modes from the command instruction.

Another minor tweak was to modify my `op(program, ptr)` method to return a variable pointer offset.
During day02 I used the return value of `op()` and treated it like a program return code in bash - meaning 0 = ok and everything else leads to an error.
With day05 every return code >= 0 is a valid return code, where the returned number equals the steps the pointer needs to take.
Negative return codes result in errors caused by unknown opcodes or parsing errors - happened a few times during building this solution ðŸ™„

== Part 2

This was not really a challenge and only meant implementing a few more instructions into my `op()` method.

== Solution

To run the solution use `ruby solution.rb`

[source, ruby]
....
include::solution.rb[]
....

=== Test cases

[source, ruby]
....
include::solution_test.rb[]
....
