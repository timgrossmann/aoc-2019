Iâ€™m not a professional developer and only doing this for fun. The solutions might me messy.

== Day 05
Adding the new opcodes and param modes to my intcomp from day 2 wasn't too difficult, and that's all that was needed for day 5.
I just hope there will be enough time for me to refactor the thing before the next extension :)
