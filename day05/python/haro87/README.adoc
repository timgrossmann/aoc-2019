== Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

The solution for the fifth day is not that hard but it still took me some
time. Structure is key and I learned some new Python features along the way.

The solution can be run by `python solution.py`:

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[]
....

The actual methods are in a separate class:

[source, python]
....
include::enterprise.py[]
....

Test cases are derived from the puzzle description and
can be run by `pytest enterprise_test.py`

[source, python]
....
include::enterprise_test.py[]
....
