Day 5 Solution in Python

== Disclaimer

The code of this solution is not perfect in any way but it seems to do its job.
This is due to the fact that I don't want to entirely miss the AOC this year
again due to family implications but instead participate in an efficient way.

So don't expect fancy interface descriptions and nicely edited readmes unless
I need it myself to handle the complexity of the puzzle :-)

== Day 05 Notes

This one drove me crazy. I didn't want to spend the effort of thorough
refactoring and test, but I ended up spending hours for trying around. 

With tests in place: Piece of cake! :-|
