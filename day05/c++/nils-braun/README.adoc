Solution for Day 05 of the AoC 2019: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5[Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Astroids]

== Solution

This time I refactored my solution for day 02 a bit - which was a good decision.
I created a Memory class which stores the current instruction pointer and added 
helper functions to get the next parameter depending on the instruction pointer and 
the current value of the parameter mode (for which I have also created a small helper class).

With these classes, the implementation was rather straight forward.

As a further TODO, one could template the parameter function to always get all 1 or 2 parameters as a parameter pack, which would make the code a bit more readable.
